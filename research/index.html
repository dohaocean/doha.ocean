	<h4>Origin of Oceanic Transform Valley </h4>
	<!-- <ol> -->
	  <li> Stronger faults promote deeper oceanic transform valleys </li>
	  <p>Recent seafloor mappings reveal global bathymetry with higher resolution, providing better observational constraints to theoretical and model developments. Ridge-parallel features like normal faults, abyssal hills and median valleys have been intensively investigated for decades. However, consensus is still lacking for the origin of hundreds of global oceanic transform valleys that connect and segment mid-ocean ridges.
	    Majority of global oceanic transform valleys are deeper than their adjacent ridges, ranging from a few hundred meters to two kilometers with an averaged relief of ~0.7 km.
	    Positive gravity anomalies for slow-slipping transform faults indicate crustal thinning, which account for part of the valley formation. However, crustal thinning alone is not enough to explain the amplitude of the observed valley relief. Meanwhile, negative gravity anomalies along fast-slipping transform faults might indicate crustal thickening, at odds with the generally observed transform valleys. 
	    Here, we build three-dimensional thermo-mechanical models to investigate the physics of oceanic transform valley formations. We follow previous mid-ocean ridge models that parameterize the ratio between dike opening to plate separation as the M value. The two simulated ridges are offset by a transform fault with a length of 40 kilometers. For fast-slipping transform faults, we set M = 1 for both dikes along the ridges. For slow-slipping transform faults, we set M = 0 near the tips of the two ridges. We found that whenever the dike opening is less than plate separation (M<1) near the transform fault, the crust thins and valleys form, which is consistent with the slow-slipping transform valleys. Surprisingly, when M is set to be 1 and there is no mass deficit, we still see comparable valley formations for the fast-slipping transform fault cases. In those suites of models, the transform valley depths increase systematically with the fault strengths.  
																																																																										 According to detailed analysis to dozens of model results, we propose a three-step mechanism for the formation of fast-slipping transform valleys:
																																																																										 First, the oceanic ridge-transform-ridge configuration localizes the strike-slip motion to occur within the weakened narrow transform fault zone.
																																																																										 Then, the shear stress along the transform can induce oblique tension across the transform fault in the adjacent plates, which asserts localized deepening within the weakened transform fault. This tension scales with the amplitude of the shear stress: when the transform fault is perfectly weak, namely the two plates can slide past each other without resistance, there is no tension; on the other hand, when the transform fault is fully locked that permit no relative strike-slip motion across the fault, tension is the largest within the two moving plates adjacent to the transform fault. In addition, we found that the resistance of the transform fault forces the dike to open preferentially more to the outside corner. This generates a net tension along the inside corner, promoting valley formation.
																																																																										 Finally, we found that the modeled mean valley relief increases monotonically with increasing transform fault strength, which indicates that deeper transform valleys might result from stronger transform faults. </p>
